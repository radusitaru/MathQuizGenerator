******************************************** MathQuizGenerator ******************************************************

1. Application scope:

- Create mathematical quizzes based on user input.

2. Application functions:

2.1 Allow user to create 3 types of mathematical quizzes:

 - randomQuiz : allow user to create random quiz based on highest number, operators, numbersInExpression, numberOfExpressions, resultType (int or double)
 - resultRangeQuiz: allow user to create a quiz that generates expressions that have a result included in a user input range.
   Moreover, the expressions themselves are generated based on highest number, operators, numbersInExpression, numberOfExpressions, resultType (int or double)
 - fixedResultQuiz: allow user to create a quiz that generates expressions that have a fixed result, based on user input.
   Moreover, the expressions themselves are generated based on highest number, operators, numbersInExpression and numberOfExpressions.

 2.2 Allow user to save quiz details, expressions and results in database

 2.3 Allow user to load a quiz saved in database.

 3. Application code structure

 3.1 The backend of this application is made of 5 java classes, which are servlets. Each servlet is responsible for a different function of the application:

 - Generator: This servlet is responsible for generating the mathematical expressions and results.
 - Quiz: This servlet is responsible for creating a quiz object, which stores all the information regarding the quiz which is being created.
         This object is used throughout the whole application as input for other methods.
 - Database: This servlet is responsible for saving and loading data from and to the database.
 - Driver: This servlet is responsible for running commands between frontend and backend.
 - ErrorHandling: This servlet is responsible for checking for input mistakes.
 - DataCollection: This servlet is responsible for reading user input from the frontend.

 3.2 The frontend of this application is made of 3 folders: Navigation, QuizTypes and Results:

 3.2.1 Navigation: Contains 2 JSP and 1 HTML files. These are the pages used for navigation:

 - Menu: HTML file responsible for directing user to create a quiz or to search an already existing quiz from database.
 - CreateQuiz: JSP file responsible for the user interface in creating quizzes.
 - ExistingQuiz: JSP file responsible for user interface in loading quiz from database.

 3.2.2 QuizTypes:

 - randomQuiz: JSP file responsible for user interface to creating a randomQuiz.
 - resultRangeQuiz: JSP file responsible for user interface to creating a resultRangeQuiz.
 - fixedResultQuiz: JSP file responsible for user interface to creating a fixedResultQuiz.

 3.2.3 Results

 - Results: JSP file responsible for displaying the newly create quiz details.
 - ExistingQuizResults: JSP file responsible for displaying the quiz details loaded from database.
